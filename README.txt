= Testimonials =

Sherwyn was able to understand me - a non-technical business owner who was handed a website by my designers with very little tutoring and no maintenance plan. EVERY TIME I write a note to Sherwyn, I receive a response and the update or edit is performed on my site with out a fuss. I am beyond grateful for his hard work and dedication. - Joy Margolis, [Nantucket Culinary Center](https://nantucketculinary.com/)
